# Pikmin-Swift
Pikmin Game in Swift
Includes 3 targets, one for each of the following: macOS, tvOS, and iOS

iOS target has the most work behind it,
macOS has the 2nd most, should be close to the same amount as iOS
tvOS should be a reasonable amount behind considering I have no screen for debugging it and I can't work while it's hooked up to the TV

FAQ
============================
Q: Why did I make this?

A: I made this for my younger brother so that he could experience a sort of taste of one of my favorite nintendo games ever. I worked on it
for a couple of days, maybe about 3 days or so, for a good amount of hours each of those days and then occasionally spruced it up every few days
or weeks since my little brother would ask me to add a few new things here and there. Lacking motivation for it currently but if I see it gains
some traction I will continue to improve it and add things

Q: How can I install this on my ____ device?

A: Xcode is required to install and because of that so is a Mac (Windows users may use a virtual machine with macOS to get Xcode)
Login with your Apple ID within the preferences of Xcode and then plugin your device and building and running should work (I'm using 
Xcode 8 beta 2 so try to use that version or newer, or else you will have to modify some of my code to fit the syntax of Swift 2, I'm
currently using Swift 3 syntax so that I can run on my iOS 10 devices but it will compile on any device with iOS 9 or higher or whatever you
set the deployment target iOS to)

Q: Where did you find the sprites you are using?

A: Searched through Google for hours, most searches lead me to several users in Deviant Art: Mattdog1000000, Ymmot392, Olio96, PikminSpriter, ryanfrogger, and others (Sorry to those I may have forgotten.)
